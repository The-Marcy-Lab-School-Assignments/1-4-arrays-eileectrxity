# Question 3

Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer

The difference between the spread operator and the rest operator is that the spread operator is used to spread elements of an existing array or properties of an object and unpack them, creating shallow copies usually into a new array or object.

Meanwhile, the rest operator is primarily used to capture all arguments passed in the parameter (of any amount and of any data type) which will then be collected and returned as a new array.
