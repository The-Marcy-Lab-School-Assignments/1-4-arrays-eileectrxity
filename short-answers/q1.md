# Question 1

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer

In the provided code, `favoriteLocations` was mutated/changed while `name` was not because the first is an array, a reference data type whose values are passed by reference and the second is a string, a primitive data type whose values are passed by value.

In summary, this is because primitive types in JS create independent copies when assigned, thus changes made to a copy does not affect the original as they are not linked to each other in memory.

Arrays on the other hand, are passed by reference, meaning that the values in both the copy and the original function are pointing to the same place in memory. Arrays and objects, being passed by reference, have linked references where changes in one affect all.
